Compiling
=======
Tale of Kingdoms builds on JDK 16 and uses Gradle.

`git clone https://gitlab.com/SamB440/tale-of-kingdoms.git`

`cd tale-of-kingdoms`

`./gradlew build`

Jar file is at `build/libs/tale-of-kingdoms-1.0.0.jar`

Hot-swapping
=======
To enable hot-swapping, do the following (in IntelliJ):
1. Use `CTRL + ALT + S`
2. Go to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger > HotSwap`
3. Check `enable HotSwap`, `Build project before reloading classes`
4. Uncheck `enable JVM will hang warning`
5. Set reload classes after compilation to `always`.

You can reload a class by right clicking it in the explorer then selecting 'Recompile x.class'

Run the `runClient` task by pressing `ALT + SHIFT + F9`, going to `tale-of-kingdoms [runClient]`, pressing the arrow and selecting debug. 
See things change as you code! Do **not** place WorldEdit in the `run/mods` folder - it's handled 
by the `build.gradle`. You can try other mods but they are not guaranteed to work in a development environment.

Upgrading textures
=====
Some textures are in the old 64x32 format. 1.9+ uses 64x64 for skin textures.
Upgrading these skins can be done by going to https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin-editor/,
selecting "upload from computer" then "download".
